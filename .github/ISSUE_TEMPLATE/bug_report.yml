      Hey there, first of all thanks for filling out this report.

      Before opening any issues:
        - First ensure that there is no similiar issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/issues).
        - Second that the issue you are having is either not mentioned on the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/wiki/Troubleshooting) or if it is mentioned there you have atleast tried the fix.

      Optinally it is also recommended to host your own Local BedrockInstance as they may be more reliable, you can find the [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW5X7-qnvLk) or [Linux](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/wiki/Setting-up-on-Linux) tutorials here.
